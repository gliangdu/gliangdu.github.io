<h2>Selected Projects</h2>
<b>CAREER: Redesign of Ancillary Services via Aggregation and Disaggregation of Information, Flexibility, and Capability</b>, National Science Foundation, 2023-2027
<table class="imgtable"><tr><td>
<img src="Career_Overview.png" alt="" height="200px" />&nbsp;</td>
<td align="left"><ul>
Uncertainties by fast-growing penetration of distributed energy resources, proliferation of electrified transportation, and climate change intertwine and amplify challenges posed on power system reliability. Consequently, widespread and prolonged outages have been occurring increasingly more frequently and severely.
Recent outages, such as the 2021 winter Texas blackout and the 2022 summer Ohio outages, illustrate that conventional ancillary services are ineffective and inadequate to address imminent reliability challenges. Collaborating with regional transmission organizations, this project aims to fundamentally redesigns the
conventional scheme of energy-ancillary service co-optimization with system-wide requirements (i.e., a resource planning-based problem) into a novel capacity-flexibility co-dispatch framework with nodal demand/capacity/flexibility composite models (i.e., a real-time control-based problem).

<li><p>First, flexibility provided by both distributed energy resources and electrified transportation is mathematically modeled and effectively aggregated</a></p></li>
<li><p>Second, the proposed nodal-level co-dispatch and redispatch is granular, rigorous, and effective since the control policies are established as theoretical co-optimization problems, converted through transformations and information aggregation, and effectively solved both precisely with guaranteed performance and approximately using real-world
T&D system data</a></p></li>
<li><p>Finally, the proposed granular control is also cost-aware with multi-scale, multi-domain cost and price models explicitly incorporated in the modeling process</a></p></li>
